Examples
--------

These examples are designed to be executed locally while following the READMEs on GitHub. All examples avoid a lengthy call to Java and the `HazardCalc` program by using the following system alias:

```Shell
alias hazard='java -cp /path/to/nshmp-haz/dist/nshmp-haz.jar org.opensha2.HazardCalc'
```

Because each example builds on prior concepts, it is best step through all the examples, however quickly.
